      <p>In this exercise we created a series of lines that all met at a center point and had some slight interactivity with the mouse, the line thickness would increase along the Y axis and the number of lines would increase along the X axis to limit the number of lines we used the map function in p5.</p>

      <p>In this exercise we created a grid of squares that followed the mouse using the arc tangent or atan function to produce the rotation angle.</p>

      <p>In this exercise we used the random fucntion between 0 and 1 to create a random pattern made up of lines and triangles with a simple if statement that said if the result is 0 draw a line and if the result is 1 draw a triangle</p>

      <p>The final exercise of the semester had us use everything we had learned so far and anytthing we had researched on our own to create a pattern intended to be printed as christmas wrapping paper using the process for exercise 04 of Color Shape, that being finding a reference image and developing a design based on that. For my design I wanted a mesh of triangles that would create a pattern where no triangles overlap To achieve this I found a mathematical function called Delaunay Triangulation which invloves ensuring no triangle lays inside the circumcircle of any other triangle to achive this computationally I employed the Bowyer Watson algorithm. Overall I was happy with the outcome however I believe I could have had better color theory applied.</p>
