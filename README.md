## Color Shape
### Exercise 01 Spectrum Loop
In this exercise we created specrum of color looped across the screen with the hue increasing across the X axis and the saturation increasing across the Y axis. this was achieved by creating a simple loop that created a grid of squares that were then filled using a gridX variable

### Exercise 02 Interactivity and Vertex introduction
This exercise involved us adding interactivity to the previous Spectrum Loop exercise, the interaction is simply mouse movement. towards the end of class we began looking at using vertices to build shapes.

### Exercise 03 Color Wheel
This exercise had us create a color wheel using the triangle fan shape to create a set of verticies that create a series of conecting triangles
